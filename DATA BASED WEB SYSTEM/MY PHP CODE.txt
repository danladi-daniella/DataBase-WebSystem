##PHP
-"HYPERTEXT PREPROCESSOR" a recurssive acronym
-Scripting language that is specially used for web development
-you can easily embed it with html
- considered a server side language= code is executed on the server, then sent to the client, meaning code is hidden.
-mainly used for web development. thats why it thought that PHP is dead. eg of apps that use php. facebook, wikipedia, canva, word press(CMS)

#PHP is divided in to 3 parts
-learning it and how to program with it
-databases-how to manipulate them
-security- how to protect the data

##setting up your php on vs code and on the local host server

##Syntax in php
-php open and closing tags = <?php?>
e.g
<body>

<p> Some HTML text.</p>
<?php echo "This is text written in PHP.";?>

</body>
-you need to memorise the tags if you want to use php codes
-in php using semicolon to end every code. it is used to output a text or string in your website. the closing php tag automatically implies a semicolon

##when it is purly php and no html
- you have your tag(opening tag) at the top of the page and closing tag will not be included but put semi colon e.g
<?php
echo "This is text written in PHP."; #so that if you accidentally leave a space things cant go wrong.

##ADVANCED EXAMPLE IF EMBEDDING PHP
<body>

<?php
if(true){
echo"<p>Some HTML text.</p>";
}
?>

</body>
-a condition statement.(<p>) used whenever you want to create an HTML text inside a webpage. so you can write HTML and context using PHP.
-the colour of text will be orange. cause its a string(in php).and it cause cause error having HTML in the string like that so you split up the string using the opening and closing php tags.
e.g

<body>

<?php if(true){?>
<p>Some HTML text.</p>
<?php}?>

</body>
- now HTML is going to be seen as a text and would be read by the editor for syntax.cause we used the opening and closing tags before and after string instead of echo.

##Writing comment inside HTML
-whenever writing a php code write comments cause as you go on you would have forgotten what that line of code does.
e.g
<?php
//Here we output a string in to browser!
echo"This is text written in PHP.";
?>
OR
<?php
/*This is how we write comments on multiple lines!
*/
?>
- in this way you can write multiple lines at once.

##PHP variable and Data Type Tutorial
<body>
   
    <p> This is a paragraph!</p>
    <?php> echo"This is ALSO a pragraph!" ?>

</body>
-(?>) helps output things

##what is a variable?
- a variable is having a memory location inside the application that stores alot of data.it has a label.
- the way you declare a variable is by using a dollar sign ($)
- "echo" is to output something in the browser.

e.g
<body>
   
    <?php
    $_name = "Dani Krossing";
    echo $name;
    ?>

</body>
- you use (_) in other to name the variable. but make sure the variable label doesnt start with a capital letter and every other text in the variable starts with a capital letter.
-if you have two words as title of a variable the first word should be in small letters and the secong,third, fourth depending how many should start with a capital letter.
e.g
<body>
   
    <?php
    $fullName = "Dani Krossing";
    echo $name;
    ?>
</body>
-recommended. stick within letter, under scores and numbers when it comes to naming a variable. and after that second word you could choose to add underscore and numbers.

##DATA TYPES
#Scaler types and Scaler basic means the variable contains 1 value init.

#Array Types. a variable that has multiple piece of data inside of it
+multiple ways of creating an array 
1. array();
2. just using brass brackets(only works for the newest versions of php if intalled)

#Object types. having an object = a variable.
- created based on classes. creating a variable object to the class.
e.g creating a variable that is a string

<body>
   
    <?php
    //scaler types(contains one value)
    $string = "Daniel";
    $int = 123454353;
    $float = 2.5678;
    $bool = true;

    //Array type
    $array = ["Daniel", "Bella", "Frida"];

    //Object type
    $object = new Car();
    ?>
</body>

##you leave every variable empty when you don't know what should be assigned to it yet
e.g
<body>
   
    <?php
    //scaler types(contains one value)
    $string = "";
    $int = 0;
    $float = 0;
    $bool = false;

    $array = [];
    $object = null;

    ?>

</body>
- when you use "$int" inuting numbers you don't use a double quote for that if not it turn s to a string.
- "Boolean" - True (1) or False(0) statement.a.k.a $bool

##FINALLY HOW TO USE VARIABLE
<body>
   
    <?php
    $name = "Dani Krossing";
    ?>

    <p>Hi! My name is <?php echo $name?>, and I am learning PHP!</p>

</body>

OR
    <?php
    $name = "Dani Krossing";
    $test = $name;
    ?>

    <p>Hi! My name is <?php echo $test?>, and I am learning PHP!</p>


##predefined Variables
- a variable that exist inside the php language

##SUPER GLOBALS
-we can access the variables in the code no matter what the scope is from anywhere in the code
- whenever you want to create a supper global you will use a dollar sign and an under score e.g

<body>
   
    <?php
    echo $SEVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"];
    echo "<br>";
    echo $SEVER["PHP_SELF"];
    ?>


</body>

-"DOCUMENT_ROOT"= give infor mation about the root path of the website
-HTML break <br>- give spacing in the output information. 
- get and post method-used when you have a form inside a website you can fill in using HTML. inside this form we have 2 attributes
1. Method- state if you want to submit the data using a get or post method.
2.Action- Getting and submitting data inside a database you can do so using a get and post method in HTML form.

<body>
   
    <?php
    echo $_SEVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"];
    echo "<br>";
    echo $_SEVER["PHP_SELF"];
    echo "<br>";
    echo $_SEVER["SERVER_NAME"];
    echo "<br>";
    echo $_SEVER["REQUEST_METHOD"];
    ?>


</body>

##OR TO GET
<body>
   
    <?php
    echo $_GET["name"];

    echo $_GET["eyecolor"];
    ?>


</body>

##Post method when used isn't visible in the URL as GET method is.it's more secretive.
##Request Method
-whenever you know you're going to be using post or get data use the get post methode instead.

<body>
   
    <?php
    echo $_REQUEST["name"];

</body>

##Files
<body>
   
    <?php
    echo $_FILES["name"];
    ?>

</body>
- for uploading a picture or file to the website. amd the type of file format you should allow.
grab information about a file uploaded by a user.

##COOKIE- a small file your server embeds on a users computer.
<body>
   
    <?php
    echo $_COOKIE["name"];
    ?>

</body>
##SESSION- grab some information about data.
<body>
   
    <?php
    $_SESSION["username"] = "krossing";
    echo $_SESSION["username"];
    ?>

</body>

##Environment variable: essentially sensitive.data that should not be available and accessible to any user.
<body>
   
    <?php
    $_ENV[];
    ?>

</body>
